    <h3>Q.1 What is Javascript?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS. <br>

        Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.

    <h3>Q.2 What is JavaScript Runtime Environment?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        A runtime environment is where your program will be executed. It determines what global objects your program can access and it can also impact how it runs. <br>
        The JavaScript runtime environment provides access to built-in libraries and objects that are available to a program so that it can interact with the outside world and make the code work.

    <h3>Q.3 What is JavaScript Engine?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        JavaScript is not understandable by computer but the only browser understands JavaScript. So, we need a program to convert our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language. A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language. <br>
        Different browsers have different javascript Engines. <br> <b> For example: </b> Google Chrome has V8 Engine, Internet explorer has Chakra , Safari has Javascript Core Webkit and Mozilla have Spider Monkey
