    <h3>Q.1 What is Javascript?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS. <br>

        Many browsers use JavaScript as a scripting language for doing dynamic things on the web. Any time you see a click-to-show dropdown menu, extra content added to a page, and dynamically changing element colors on a page, to name a few features, you're seeing the effects of JavaScript.

    <h3>Q.2 What is JavaScript Runtime Environment?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        A runtime environment is where your program will be executed. It determines what global objects your program can access and it can also impact how it runs. <br>
        The JavaScript runtime environment provides access to built-in libraries and objects that are available to a program so that it can interact with the outside world and make the code work.

    <h3>Q.3 What is JavaScript Engine?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        JavaScript is not understandable by computer but the only browser understands JavaScript. So, we need a program to convert our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language. A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language. <br>
        Different browsers have different javascript Engines. <br> <b> For example: </b> Google Chrome has V8 Engine, Internet explorer has Chakra , Safari has Javascript Core Webkit and Mozilla have Spider Monkey

    <h3>Q.5 Explain var, let and const? </h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        <b>Var:- </b> Variables declared with var-keyword are only accessible in the function-scope. Re-assigning a value of a variable is allowed. Re-declaration of similar identifiers is allowed.

        <pre>           
            // block-scope
            if (true) { 
                var a = 10;
            }
            console.log(a); // accessible outside block-scope

            // function-scope
            function demo () {  
                var b = 20;
                console.log(b); // accessible within function-scope
            }
            demo(); // function invoked
            // console.log(b); // refernece-error 
        </pre>

        <b>let:- </b>Variables declared with let-keyword are only accessible in block-scope. Re-assigning a value of a variable is allowed.But Re-declaration of similar identifiers is not allowed.
        <pre>
            // block-scope
            if (true) { 
                let a = 10;     
                a = 20;         // Re-Assignment to let variable applicable
                let a = 20;     // syntax-error (Identifier 'a' has already been declared)
                
            }
            console.log(a);     // refernece-error (a is not defined)
        </pre>


        <b>const:- </b>Variables declared with const-keyword are only accessible in the block-scope. Re-assigning a value of a variable is not allowed. Re-declaration of similar identifiers is also not allowed.

        <pre>
            // block-scope
            if (true) { 
                const a = 10; 
                a = 20;         // type-error (Re-Assignment to constant variable)
                const a = 20;   // syntax-error (Identifier 'a' has already been declared)
                console.log(a); // accessible within block-scope
            }
            console.log(a);     // refernece-error (a is not defined)
        </pre>
         


    </div>

    <h3>Q.6 What is Hoisting?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation. <br>
        In JavaScript, Hoisting is the default behavior of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution. Basically, it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
    </div>

    <h3>Q.7 What is Temporal Dead Zone?</h3>
    <div class="Answer">
        The let and const variables are not accessible before they are initialized with some value, and the phase between the starting of the execution of block in which the let or const variable is declared till that variable is being initialized is called Temporal Dead Zone for the variable
